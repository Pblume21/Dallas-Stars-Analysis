# Dallas-Stars-Analysis
Just a short python analysis of hockey statics taken from Moneypuck.com
My Canadian friend got me into hockey a few years ago and since the Houston Aeros no longer exist my team has become the Dallas Stars.
So I thought it would be fun to do some analysis of them across the years with python.
